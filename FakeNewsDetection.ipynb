Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said two police and one civilian were killed and five people wounded. Local Tolo News Television quoted the Afghan Cricket Board as saying all players were safe. The blast outside Kabul International Cricket Stadium took place during a match in Afghanistan s Shpageeza Cricket League, a T20 franchise tournament on the lines of the Indian Premier League and similar 20-over tournaments. A statement in Bosnian on Islamic State s Amaq news agency said a suicide attack had been carried out on members of the Afghan security forces in Kabul ,  although it was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to the same incident. The Shpageeza tournament, now in its fifth season, is one of a small number of Western-style sports competitions along with Afghan Premier League football that have grown up since a U.S.-led campaign toppled the Taliban in 2001. A small number of foreign players are also taking part in the competition. Cricket, which spread from refugee camps in Pakistan, has become one of Afghanistan s most popular sports and the national team has become increasingly successful, raising the profile of the game.

A benefit concert entitled  We Are Manchester  will raise money for a charitable trust in charge of establishing a permanent memorial in the northern English city. The victims of the May 22 attack at the Manchester Arena included many young girls, who make up a large part of U.S. singer Grande s fan base. The youngest, Saffie Roussos, was aged eight.  Parents who had come to pick up their children after the show were also among those killed in the attack carried out by Salman Abedi.  May s events will never be forgotten, but they will not stop us, or Mancunian music fans, from coming together to enjoy live music,  James Allen, the venue s general manager, said in a statement. The line-up for Saturday s concert, which was sold out, included Noel Gallagher, formerly of Oasis, one of the most successful bands to emerge from Manchester. Also performing will be local poet Tony Walsh, known as Longfella, who moved crowds to tears at a vigil in central Manchester the day after the attack with his poem  This Is The Place  which celebrates the spirit of the city. Grande will not take part, having performed at a previous benefit concert,  One Love Manchester , which raised funds for victims. The June 4 concert, which took place at a cricket ground in Manchester, also featured artists including Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus and Pharrell Williams. '])\n",
